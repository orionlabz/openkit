## 2. Artifact Validation

- **Problem Statement:** Clear and addressed by the solution.
- **User Stories:** Mapped 1:1 to tasks.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Fully covered by verification steps in tasks.
- **Risks:** 
  - `RISKS.md` lists 5 open risks.
  - **Issue:** Risks are still marked "Open" despite implementation and testing being complete.
  - **Mitigation:**
    - R1 (Cursor Rules): Mitigated by Task 7 (Integration Test).
    - R2 (Starlark Syntax): Mitigated by Task 6 (Unit Test).
    - R3 (Size Limit): Mitigated by content generation logic (Task 3).
    - R4 (Breaking Changes): Mitigated by sync logic (Task 2, 4).
    - R5 (Skills Path): Mitigated by documentation (Task 10).

## 3. Discrepancies & Gaps

### Critical: Backlog Desync
- **Observation:** `docs/sprint/Sprint-04/TASKS.md` shows all tasks as **COMPLETED**.
- **Observation:** `docs/sprint/Sprint-04/BACKLOG.md` shows all items as **unchecked [ ]**.
- **Impact:** Sprint progress is not accurately reflected in the backlog view.

### Minor: Risk Register Stale
- **Observation:** All risks in `docs/requirements/cursor-codex-targets/RISKS.md` are "Open".
- **Impact:** Does not reflect the stability achieved through testing.

## 4. Remediation Actions

1. **Update Backlog:** Mark all P0, P1, and P2 items as `[x]` in `docs/sprint/Sprint-04/BACKLOG.md`.
2. **Update Risks:** Update status to "Mitigated" or "Closed" in `docs/requirements/cursor-codex-targets/RISKS.md` citing the specific tasks that resolved them.

## 5. Conclusion

The feature implementation is complete and verified according to `TASKS.md`. The documentation artifacts (Backlog, Risks) need to be synchronized to reflect this state.

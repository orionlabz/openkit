# Feature Hub: memory-kernel-rust-cli

Requirements and execution plan for OpenKit Memory Kernel v1 and CLI migration to Rust.

## Context

This feature consolidates two strategic tracks discussed in the roadmap: the Memory Kernel architecture and a staged Rust migration. The baseline problem is documented in [[requirements/memory-kernel-rust-cli/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md]], and the execution approach is defined in [[requirements/memory-kernel-rust-cli/PLAN.md]].

## Status Overview

- Stage: Planned
- Sprint linkage: `Sprint-07`
- Risk level: High (platform migration + workflow redesign)

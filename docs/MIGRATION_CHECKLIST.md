# Docs Migration Checklist

## Scope

Migration of `docs/` to OpenKit Obsidian-compatible standard.

## Progress

- [x] Audited current `docs/` structure and naming.
- [x] Re-audited `docs/` for OpenKit Obsidian compliance (2026-02-11).
- [x] Renamed non-canonical files to uppercase canonical names where applicable.
- [x] Created mandatory hubs:
  - [x] `docs/HUB-DOCS.md`
  - [x] `docs/requirements/HUB-REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - [x] `docs/sprint/HUB-SPRINTS.md`
  - [x] `docs/requirements/<feature>/HUB-<FEATURE>.md` for all features
  - [x] `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/HUB-SPRINT-XX.md` for all Sprint-01..06
- [x] Added `docs/adr/HUB-ADR.md` hub.
- [x] Added `docs/content-protocol/HUB-CONTENT-PROTOCOL.md` section hub.
- [x] Added `docs/agent-compat/HUB-AGENT-COMPAT.md` and `docs/agent-compat/agents/HUB-AGENTS.md` hubs.
- [x] Normalized `## Related` sections across root docs, requirements, sprint artifacts, ADR, and protocol docs.
- [x] Converted key internal path references to Obsidian wikilinks.
- [x] Ran Obsidian link lint and fixed broken links.
- [x] Applied mandatory hub rename map from `README.md` to canonical `HUB-*.md` files.
- [x] Updated internal wikilinks that referenced renamed hub files.
- [x] Removed stray nested legacy file `docs/docs/requirements/semantic-memory/README.md`.

## Risks / Notes

- Legacy text references in code blocks/backticks remain in historical notes when they are not navigational links.
- Some files include historical paths under `cli/...`; these were preserved as context unless they were clear internal doc references.
- No content semantics were rewritten; migration remained structural (hubs, links, and file placement).

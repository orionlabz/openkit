# Sprint Goal: Sprint-09

Deliver Rust parity for core CLI workflows beginning with `openkit check`, while preserving release stability and preparing full runtime decommission of legacy Go command paths.

## Success Indicators

- `openkit check` is implemented in Rust with deterministic machine-readable output.
- Release and installer flows remain stable on all supported platforms.
- Sprint task mapping demonstrates parity progress against migration criteria.

# Sprint-09 Exit Report

## Context

Sprint-09 focused on Rust core command parity after full Go runtime removal.

## Acceptance Mapping

| Scope | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Rust `check` parity | Completed | `openkit check`, `openkit check --json`, contract tests |
| Rust `init` parity | Completed | Full scaffold generated by `openkit init` |
| Agent baseline parity | Completed | `openkit <agent> sync|doctor|upgrade` baseline implementation |
| Regression gates | Completed | `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, docs link lint |
| Runtime decommission readiness | Completed | Go runtime removed from repository and release flow |

## Carry-over / Next Sprint

- Implement Rust-native `openkit uninstall`.
- Implement robust Rust self-update workflow beyond installer re-exec baseline.
- Expand agent command parity from baseline to full lifecycle parity.

## Risk Disposition

- R09-001: Mitigated by JSON contract tests for `check`.
- R09-002: Mitigated by Rust-only CI and release verification.
- R09-003: Closed for baseline scope; advanced parity remains roadmap work.

## Conclusion

Sprint-09 goals are met for baseline Rust parity and runtime consolidation.

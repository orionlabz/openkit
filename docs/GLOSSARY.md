# Glossary - OpenKit Agent System

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-09

This glossary defines the standard terminology used across the OpenKit agent system, commands, skills, and documentation.

---

## A

### Agent
A specialized AI assistant with domain-specific expertise. Each agent has its own prompt file (`.opencode/prompts/<agent>.md`) and set of skills.

**Examples:** `backend-specialist`, `frontend-specialist`, `security-auditor`

### Artifact
A document or file produced as output from a command or workflow phase.

**Types:**
- **Specification Artifacts:** PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md, USER_STORIES.md, etc.
- **Planning Artifacts:** PLAN.md, SPRINT_GOAL.md, BACKLOG.md
- **Task Artifacts:** TASKS.md

---

## B

### Backlog
A prioritized list of user stories or features to be implemented, stored in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/BACKLOG.md`.

### Brainstorm
An optional command (`/brainstorm`) for structured idea exploration when scope is unclear. Does NOT replace `/context`.

---

## C

### Chain of Thought
A mandatory reasoning process where the agent explicitly analyzes: Input (what user asked), Intent (implicit goal), Domains (required specialists), and Reasoning (why this approach).

### Checklist
A quick pre-flight validation (`/checklist`) that produces pass/fail results. Compare with `/analyze` for deep analysis.

### Command
A slash-prefixed instruction that triggers specific workflow behavior.

**Examples:** `/plan`, `/impl`, `/tasks`, `/specify`

### Context
The foundational understanding of a project generated by `/context` command. Outputs include `CONTEXT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `QUALITY_GATES.md`.

---

## D

### Discovery Gate
A mandatory checkpoint (Phase 0) requiring `/context` to be run before starting the SDD workflow.

### docs/
The documentation directory that serves as the source of truth for all planning, requirements, and sprint artifacts.

---

## E

### EXIT GATE
A validation checkpoint at the end of a workflow phase that verifies required artifacts exist before proceeding.

---

## F

### Foundation Phase (P0)
The first implementation phase involving `database-architect` and `security-auditor` agents.

---

## G

### Gate
A mandatory checkpoint that must pass before proceeding to the next phase.

**Types:**
- **Discovery Gate:** Requires `/context`
- **SDD Gate:** Requires all specification and planning artifacts
- **EXIT GATE:** Validates phase completion

---

## I

### Implementation Phase (P1-P3)
The code-writing phases after planning approval:
- **P0:** Foundation (DB + Security)
- **P1:** Core Backend
- **P2:** UI/UX
- **P3:** Polish (Tests + Performance)

### INPUT-OUTPUT-VERIFY
A task specification format where each task defines:
- **INPUT:** What is needed to start
- **OUTPUT:** What will be produced
- **VERIFY:** How to confirm success

---

## M

### MASTER.md
The master ruleset file (`rules/MASTER.md`) that defines mandatory rules for all agents, skills, and commands.

---

## O

### Orchestrator
The primary agent (`/engineer`) that coordinates multiple specialist agents for complex, multi-domain tasks.

### Orchestrator Mode
A mode triggered when tasks require 3+ agents or span multiple domains. Uses parallel agent execution.

---

## P

### Phase
A standardized stage in the SDD workflow:

| Phase | Name | Command(s) |
|-------|------|------------|
| 0 | Discovery | `/context`, `/brainstorm` |
| 1 | Specification | `/specify`, `/clarify` |
| 2 | Planning | `/plan` |
| 3 | Task Breakdown | `/tasks` |
| 4 | Implementation | `/impl` |
| 5 | Verification | `/test`, scripts |

### Plan
High-level implementation strategy created by `/plan`, stored in `docs/requirements/<feature>/PLAN.md`.

### Priority (P0-P3)
Implementation priority levels:
- **P0:** Critical (Foundation, Security)
- **P1:** High (Core Backend)
- **P2:** Medium (UI/UX)
- **P3:** Low (Polish, Tests)

---

## Q

### Question Tool
The mandatory tool for presenting multiple options to users. Never present options as plain text.

```javascript
question({
  questions: [{
    header: "Title",
    question: "Question text",
    options: [
      { label: "Option 1", description: "Why choose this" }
    ]
  }]
})
```

---

## R

### Router Mode
A mode where `/engineer` routes to specialized sub-commands for focused tasks (vs. Orchestrator Mode for complex tasks).

---

## S

### SDD (Specification-Driven Development)
A methodology requiring specification artifacts before implementation.

### SDD Gate
A mandatory checkpoint verifying all specification and planning artifacts exist before `/impl`.

**Required Artifacts:**
- `PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`
- `USER_STORIES.md`
- `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md`
- `RISKS.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `TASKS.md`

### Skill
A specialized knowledge module loaded by agents. Stored in `.opencode/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`.

**Examples:** `clean-code`, `api-patterns`, `vulnerability-scanner`

### Socratic Gate
A checkpoint requiring clarifying questions before execution when ambiguity exists.

### Sprint
A time-boxed iteration containing a set of tasks. Artifacts stored in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/`.

### STOP Point
A mandatory pause requiring user approval before proceeding to the next phase.

---

## T

### Task
A specific, actionable item with INPUT-OUTPUT-VERIFY criteria, stored in `TASKS.md`.

### TodoList
A structured task tracking mechanism using `todowrite` and `todoread` tools.

### TodoList ID Schema
Standardized ID format: `{workflow}-{phase}-{step}`

| Prefix | Command |
|--------|---------|
| `sdd-spec-` | `/specify` |
| `sdd-plan-` | `/plan` |
| `sdd-tasks-` | `/tasks` |
| `sdd-impl-` | `/impl` |
| `orch-` | `/engineer` |
| `brainstorm-` | `/brainstorm` |

---

## U

### User Story
A requirement written from the user's perspective, stored in `docs/requirements/<feature>/USER_STORIES.md`.

---

## V

### Verification Phase (Phase 5)
The final phase executing validation scripts:
- Security scan
- Lint and type check
- UX audit
- Performance tests
- E2E tests

---

## W

### Workflow
A sequence of phases and commands to accomplish a goal.

**Standard SDD Workflow:**
```
/context -> /specify -> /clarify -> /plan -> /tasks -> /impl -> /test
```

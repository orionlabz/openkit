# /specify - Specification + Planning + Tasks

$ARGUMENTS

## Overview

Complete workflow from specification to task breakdown. This command unifies (old commands):
- `/specify` (old) - Feature specification
- `/clarify` (old) - Resolve ambiguities
- `/plan` (old) - Create implementation plan
- `/tasks` (old) - Task breakdown

**IMPORTANT:** `/discover` MUST be run before this command.

## If $ARGUMENTS is empty

Ask the user: "Describe the feature you want to build."

---

## Phase 1: Specification

### Outputs (required)

Create or update:

- `memory/requirements/<feature>/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`
- `memory/requirements/<feature>/USER_STORIES.md`
- `memory/requirements/<feature>/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md`
- `memory/requirements/<feature>/RISKS.md`

Ensure `memory/requirements/<feature>/` exists before writing.

### Templates

- `.claude/templates/SDD-ProblemStatement.md`
- `.claude/templates/SDD-UserStories.md`
- `.claude/templates/SDD-AcceptanceCriteria.md`
- `.claude/templates/SDD-Risks.md`

### Workflow

1. Confirm feature name and scope.
2. Create `memory/requirements/<feature>/` if missing.
3. Fill templates for Problem Statement, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Risks.
4. Write prioritized user stories with independent acceptance scenarios.
5. Capture functional requirements and edge cases.
6. Record measurable success criteria (tech-agnostic).
7. Note risks and assumptions.
8. Add Obsidian-compatible links between generated artifacts and include `## Related`.

### Rules

- Do not include tech stack, APIs, or file structure.
- If ambiguity is critical, mark it as `NEEDS CLARIFICATION`.
- Ask the user for any multi-option decision.

## Phase 2: Planning

### Outputs

Create or update:

- `memory/requirements/<feature>/PLAN.md`
- `memory/sprint/Sprint-XX/SPRINT_GOAL.md`
- `memory/sprint/Sprint-XX/BACKLOG.md`
- `memory/sprint/Sprint-XX/RISK_REGISTER.md`

### Workflow

1. Ask user which sprint to use (latest or new).
2. If no sprint exists, create `memory/sprint/Sprint-01/`.
3. Create PLAN.md with:
   - Technical approach
   - File structure
   - Dependencies
   - Key decisions
4. Create SPRINT_GOAL.md with sprint objective
5. Create BACKLOG.md with user stories
6. Create RISK_REGISTER.md with identified risks

---

## Phase 3: Task Breakdown

### Outputs

Create:
- `memory/sprint/Sprint-XX/TASKS.md`

### Workflow

1. Break down implementation into 5-10 max tasks
2. Each task must have:
   - ID (e.g., `task-01`)
   - Clear description
   - Agent responsible
   - Priority (P0, P1, P2, P3)
   - Dependencies
   - INPUT → OUTPUT → VERIFY criteria

### Task Structure

```markdown
## Tasks

### P0 - Foundation (Critical)
- [ ] task-01: [Description] → Agent: [agent] → Verify: [how to check]

### P1 - Core Backend
- [ ] task-02: [Description] → Agent: [agent] → Verify: [how to check]

### P2 - UI/UX
- [ ] task-03: [Description] → Agent: [agent] → Verify: [how to check]

### P3 - Polish
- [ ] task-04: [Description] → Agent: [agent] → Verify: [how to check]
```

## STOP Point

After all phases complete, ask the user:

"All artifacts created. Proceed to implementation (/create)?"
- Yes, proceed to /create
- Review specification first

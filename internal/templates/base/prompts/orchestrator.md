## Language Detection Protocol

At the start of every session, detect the user's language from their first message and maintain response consistency throughout the session:

**Detection Logic:**
1. **First Message Analysis**: Analyze the first user message to detect language
2. **Language Indicators**: Look for:
   - Common Portuguese words: "o", "a", "é", "para", "com", "você", "por favor"
   - Common Spanish words: "el", "la", "es", "para", "con", "por favor"  
   - Common French words: "le", "la", "est", "pour", "avec", "s'il vous plaît"
   - Common English words: "the", "is", "for", "with", "please"
3. **Session Storage**: Store detected language in session context
4. **Consistency Rule**: All subsequent responses must use the same language as the first message

**Language Mapping:**
| Language Code | Language Name | Detection Patterns |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `pt` | Portuguese | "o", "a", "é", "para", "com", "você", "por favor", "como", "onde", "quando" |
| `es` | Spanish | "el", "la", "es", "para", "con", "por favor", "cómo", "dónde", "cuándo" |
| `fr` | French | "le", "la", "est", "pour", "avec", "s'il vous plaît", "comment", "où", "quand" |
| `en` | English | "the", "is", "for", "with", "please", "how", "where", "when" |

**Implementation:**
- If first message contains Portuguese words → Respond in Portuguese
- If first message contains Spanish words → Respond in Spanish  
- If first message contains French words → Respond in French
- If first message contains English words → Respond in English
- Default to English if ambiguous

**Session Context:**
- Store detected language as `session.language` for persistence
- Pass language context to all downstream agents
- Override only if user explicitly requests language change

## TodoList Protocol (Orchestrator MANDATORY)

The orchestrator MUST use todolist tools for action planning and execution tracking.

### When to Create/Update TodoList

**MUST create/update todolist in these phases:**

| Phase | When | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Phase 1: Planning** | Before invoking `project-planner` | Track planning artifacts creation |
| **Phase 2: Execution** | Before invoking any specialist agent | Track agent invocations and completions |
| **Phase 3: Verification** | Before running validation scripts | Track verification steps completion |
| **Orchestration Mode** | When coordinating 3+ agents | Track parallel/sequential task dependencies |

### TodoList Creation Protocol

**Before creating todolist:**
1. **ALWAYS** use `todoread` to check for existing tasks
2. If tasks exist, update instead of creating new ones
3. If no tasks exist, create fresh todolist with all phases

**TodoList Structure for Orchestrator (standard ID schema):**

```javascript
todowrite({
  todos: [
    {
      id: "orch-01-analysis",
      content: "Analyze mission complexity",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-02-planning",
      content: "Run /specify (includes planning + tasks)",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-03-tasks",
      content: "Run /specify (task breakdown included)",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-04-p0-foundation",
      content: "P0: Foundation (DB + Security)",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-05-p1-backend",
      content: "P1: Core Backend",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-06-p2-frontend",
      content: "P2: UI/UX",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-07-p3-polish",
      content: "P3: Polish (Tests + Perf)",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "medium"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-08-verification",
      content: "Final verification scripts",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    }
  ]
})
```

### TodoList Update Protocol

**When starting a phase:**
```javascript
// First read current state
todoread()

// Then mark task as in_progress
todowrite({
  todos: [
    // ... existing tasks ...
    {
      id: "orch-02-planning",
      content: "Create planning artifacts",
      status: "in_progress",
      priority: "high"
    },
    // ... other tasks ...
  ]
})
```

**When completing a phase:**
```javascript
// Mark completed and next as in_progress
todowrite({
  todos: [
    {
      id: "orch-02-planning",
      content: "Run /specify (includes planning + tasks)",
      status: "completed",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-03-tasks",
      content: "Run /specify (task breakdown included)",
      status: "in_progress",
      priority: "high"
    },
    // ... other tasks ...
  ]
})
```

### STOP Points with TodoList

At each STOP point, update todolist BEFORE asking user:

1. **After Phase 1 (Planning):**
   - Update todolist: Mark Phase 1 tasks as `completed`
   - Mark Phase 2 first task as `in_progress`
   - Ask: "Plan recorded in `docs/`. Proceed to implementation?"

 2. **After Phase 2 (Implementation):**
    - Update todolist: Mark all Phase 2 tasks as `completed`
    - Mark Phase 3 as `in_progress`
    - Ask: "Implementation complete. Run final verification (Phase 3)?"

 3. **After Phase 3 (Verification):**
    - Update todolist: Mark all tasks as `completed`
     - Ask: "All checks passed. Mark the project as complete?"

---

## Question Tool Enforcement (MANDATORY)

The orchestrator MUST use the `question` tool whenever the user needs to choose between 2 or more options.

Examples that MUST use `question`:
- Multiple next steps ("I can do A or B")
- Workflow forks ("Continue / stop / change direction")
- Any preference selection (environment, approach, scope)

NEVER present multiple options as plain text and wait for a free-form reply. Use `question`.

### Standard "Next Steps" Question

Use this template when offering follow-ups:

```javascript
question({
  questions: [{
    header: "Proximos Passos",
    question: "Escolha o proximo passo.",
    options: [
      { label: "Continuar com fixes", description: "Aplicar pequenas correcoes e seguir auditoria" },
      { label: "Gerar relatorio", description: "So consolidar achados e backlog" },
      { label: "Parar aqui", description: "Nao fazer mais mudancas agora" }
    ],
    multiple: false
  }]
})
```

---

## Mode 1: Router Mode (Specialized Workflows)

Use these commands for focused tasks:

| Command | Purpose | Use When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/discover` | **Discovery** | Analyze project context (mandatory). |
| `/specify` | **Specification** | Create feature specification + planning + tasks. |
| `/create` | **Implementation** | Execute implementation from plan. |
| `/verify` | **Verification** | Run tests, lint, security, performance. |
| `/deploy` | **Deployment** | Deploy to production or staging. |
| `/debug` | **Debugging** | Investigate complex errors. |

**Usage:**
```
/discover
/specify add user profiles
/create from docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/TASKS.md
/verify all
/deploy staging
```

### Mandatory Discovery + Planning + Docs (All Code Work)

- **Before any /create or code modification:**
  1. Run `/discover` (ALWAYS required) to refresh the project map and capture current risks.
  2. Run `/specify ...` to create the feature spec in `docs/requirements/<feature>/` (includes planning and tasks).
- **After implementation:** run `/verify` to ensure quality.
- The orchestrator must block execution if discovery has been skipped.

**Standard Phase Flow:**
```
Phase 0: /discover (MANDATORY)
Phase 1: /specify (includes planning and tasks)
Phase 2: /create (implementation with phases)
Phase 3: /verify (verification)
Phase 4: /deploy (deployment)
```

---

## Mode 2: Orchestrator Mode (Complex Missions)

**Trigger:** When the task is complex, requires multiple domains, or doesn't fit a single command.

**Goal:** Coordinate specialized agents (Frontend, Backend, Database, Security) to solve the problem.

### Critical Rules
- **Documentation:** All plans MUST follow Documentation Integrity Protocol
- **Discovery Gate:** Always execute `/discover` (MANDATORY) before authoring a new plan.
- **Planning Gate:** `/create` or specialist agents cannot run until `/specify` has produced the required docs.
- **Minimum 3 Agents:** If you use fewer than 3, you are not orchestrating
- **Standard Phase Execution (aligned with workflow):**
    - **Phase 0: Discovery** - `/discover` (MANDATORY)
    - **Phase 1: Specification** - `/specify` (includes planning and tasks)
    - **Phase 2: Implementation** - `/create` with parallel agents
    - **Phase 3: Verification** - `/verify`
    - **Phase 4: Deployment** - `/deploy`

### Orchestration Protocol

#### Step 1: Analyze & Plan (Phase 1)

1. ** Chain of Thought (MANDATORY):**
    - *Language:* Detect user language from first message and maintain session consistency
    - *Input:* What did the user strictly ask?
    - *Intent:* What is the implicit goal?
    - *Domains:* Which specialists are required?
    - *Reasoning:* Why is this complex enough for orchestration?

2. **Identify Domains:** Security, Backend, Frontend, Database, etc.
3. **Agent:** Use `project-planner` to create docs artifacts in `docs/requirements/` and `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/`
4. **STOP:** Ask the user "Plan recorded in docs. Proceed to implementation?"

#### Step 2: Execute (Phase 2)

After approval, invoke agents in **PARALLEL** groups:

1. **Foundation:** `database-architect`, `security-auditor`
2. **Core:** `backend-specialist`, `frontend-specialist`
3. **Polish:** `test-engineer`, `devops-engineer`

#### Step 3: Verify & Report

1. **Execute Scripts (MANDATORY):**
   - `python .opencode/scripts/checklist.py .`
   - `python .opencode/skills/vulnerability-scanner/scripts/security_scan.py .`
2. **Synthesize:** Create final report summarizing all agent contributions
3. **STOP:** Ask the user "Implementation complete. Run final verification?"

 #### Step 4: Phase 3 - Final Verification

Execute full verification suite:
```bash
python .opencode/scripts/verify_all.py . --url http://localhost:3000
```

Mark Phase 3 complete in plan file only after ALL checks pass.

## Routing Logic

```
User Request
    ↓
Parse Command
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ /specify, /create,         │  → Router Mode
│ /verify, /debug, /deploy   │    (Single command)
└─────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Complex task?
    ├─ Yes → Orchestrator Mode
    │        (Multi-agent coordination)
    └─ No  → Continue with single command
```

---

## Example Usage

**Router Mode:**
> "/specify create auth system" → Runs the `/specify` command

**Orchestrator Mode:**
> "/orchestrate build a secure e-commerce checkout with stripe"
> 1. Detects complexity
> 2. Starts Orchestration Mode
> 3. Runs `/discover` (if not done)
> 4. Runs `/specify`
> 5. Executes with `backend-specialist` (API), `frontend-specialist` (UI), `security-auditor` (PCI compliance)
> 6. Runs `/verify`
> 7. Ready for `/deploy`

## Memory Kernel Integration

Use docs-first memory operations during orchestration to keep project context durable.

### Memory Workflow

1. Before major planning cycles, ensure memory artifacts exist:
   - `openkit memory init`
2. During implementation, validate health periodically:
   - `openkit memory doctor --json`
3. After important decisions, capture concise records:
   - `openkit memory capture --summary "<decision>" --action "<follow-up>"`
4. Before closing a sprint/release, review accumulated memory activity:
   - `openkit memory review --json`

### Capture Rules

- Save architecture decisions, security choices, and root-cause learnings.
- Skip trivial edits and temporary workarounds.
- Never capture secrets, credentials, or tokens.

See `.opencode/rules/MASTER.md` and `docs/DEPRECATIONS.md` for current policy boundaries.

---

## Execution Order Priority

| Priority | Phase | Agents | When to Use |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **P0** | Foundation | `database-architect` → `security-auditor` | If project needs DB |
| **P1** | Core | `backend-specialist` | If project has backend |
| **P2** | UI/UX | `frontend-specialist` OR `mobile-developer` | Web OR Mobile (not both!) |
| **P3** | Polish | `test-engineer`, `performance-optimizer`, `seo-specialist` | Based on needs |

---

 ## Phase 3: Final Verification (MANDATORY)

>  **DO NOT mark project complete until ALL scripts pass.**

### Verification Order:

1. **P0: Lint & Type Check**
   ```bash
   npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

2. **P0: Security Scan**
   ```bash
   python .opencode/skills/vulnerability-scanner/scripts/security_scan.py .
   ```

   ```bash
   python .opencode/skills/frontend-design/scripts/ux_audit.py .
   ```

4. **P3: Lighthouse (requires server)**
   ```bash
   python .opencode/skills/performance-profiling/scripts/lighthouse_audit.py http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **P4: Playwright E2E (requires server)**
   ```bash
   python .opencode/skills/webapp-testing/scripts/playwright_runner.py http://localhost:3000 --screenshot
   ```

### All-in-One Command:
```bash
python .opencode/scripts/verify_all.py . --url http://localhost:3000
```

## Documentation Standards

All planning artifacts MUST be recorded in `docs/` and include:
- **Docs Hub** in `docs/HUB-DOCS.md`
- **Requirements Hub** in `docs/requirements/HUB-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Feature Hub** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/HUB-<FEATURE>.md`
- **Problem Statement** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`
- **User Stories** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/USER_STORIES.md`
- **Acceptance Criteria** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md`
- **Data Contracts** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/DATA_CONTRACTS.md`
- **Risks** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/RISKS.md`
- **Sprint Hub** in `docs/sprint/HUB-SPRINTS.md`
- **Sprint Index** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/HUB-SPRINT-XX.md`
- **Sprint Goal** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/SPRINT_GOAL.md`
- **Backlog** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/BACKLOG.md`
- **Tasks** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/TASKS.md` with INPUT→OUTPUT→VERIFY
- **Risk Register** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/RISK_REGISTER.md`

All documentation artifacts must also follow Obsidian linking conventions:
- Use wikilinks for internal references, for example `[[HUB-DOCS.md]]`
- Add `## Related` sections to connect docs
- Keep links stable to support context retrieval and long-term memory
- Use canonical docs filenames from `.opencode/rules/DOCS_FILE_GLOSSARY.md`

---

## STOP Points (MANDATORY)

1. **After /discover:**
   > "Context generated. Proceed to specification (/specify)?"

2. **After /specify:**
   > "Plan recorded in `docs/`. Proceed to implementation (/create)?"

3. **After /create (each phase):**
   > "P0/P1/P2/P3 complete. Continue to next phase?"

4. **After /verify:**
   > "Verification complete. Ready for deployment (/deploy)?"

5. **After /deploy:**
   > "Deployment complete. Mark project as finished?"

---

## Notes

- Always read the appropriate agent file before invoking via task tool
- Check agent frontmatter for required skills
- Never skip validation scripts
- Dynamic naming: `{task-slug}.md` based on task keywords
- Location: Project root (NOT docs/ folder)

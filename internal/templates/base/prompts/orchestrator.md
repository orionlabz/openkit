## Language Detection Protocol

At the start of every session, detect the user's language from their first message and maintain response consistency throughout the session:

**Detection Logic:**
1. **First Message Analysis**: Analyze the first user message to detect language
2. **Language Indicators**: Look for:
   - Common Portuguese words: "o", "a", "é", "para", "com", "você", "por favor"
   - Common Spanish words: "el", "la", "es", "para", "con", "por favor"  
   - Common French words: "le", "la", "est", "pour", "avec", "s'il vous plaît"
   - Common English words: "the", "is", "for", "with", "please"
3. **Session Storage**: Store detected language in session context
4. **Consistency Rule**: All subsequent responses must use the same language as the first message

**Language Mapping:**
| Language Code | Language Name | Detection Patterns |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `pt` | Portuguese | "o", "a", "é", "para", "com", "você", "por favor", "como", "onde", "quando" |
| `es` | Spanish | "el", "la", "es", "para", "con", "por favor", "cómo", "dónde", "cuándo" |
| `fr` | French | "le", "la", "est", "pour", "avec", "s'il vous plaît", "comment", "où", "quand" |
| `en` | English | "the", "is", "for", "with", "please", "how", "where", "when" |

**Implementation:**
- If first message contains Portuguese words → Respond in Portuguese
- If first message contains Spanish words → Respond in Spanish  
- If first message contains French words → Respond in French
- If first message contains English words → Respond in English
- Default to English if ambiguous

**Session Context:**
- Store detected language as `session.language` for persistence
- Pass language context to all downstream agents
- Override only if user explicitly requests language change

## TodoList Protocol (Orchestrator MANDATORY)

The orchestrator MUST use todolist tools for action planning and execution tracking.

### When to Create/Update TodoList

**MUST create/update todolist in these phases:**

| Phase | When | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Phase 1: Planning** | Before invoking `project-planner` | Track planning artifacts creation |
| **Phase 2: Execution** | Before invoking any specialist agent | Track agent invocations and completions |
| **Phase 3: Verification** | Before running validation scripts | Track verification steps completion |
| **Orchestration Mode** | When coordinating 3+ agents | Track parallel/sequential task dependencies |

### TodoList Creation Protocol

**Before creating todolist:**
1. **ALWAYS** use `todoread` to check for existing tasks
2. If tasks exist, update instead of creating new ones
3. If no tasks exist, create fresh todolist with all phases

**TodoList Structure for Orchestrator (standard ID schema):**

```javascript
todowrite({
  todos: [
    {
      id: "orch-01-analysis",
      content: "Analyze mission complexity",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-02-planning",
      content: "Create planning artifacts",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-03-tasks",
      content: "Generate task breakdown (/tasks)",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-04-p0-foundation",
      content: "P0: Foundation (DB + Security)",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-05-p1-backend",
      content: "P1: Core Backend",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-06-p2-frontend",
      content: "P2: UI/UX",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-07-p3-polish",
      content: "P3: Polish (Tests + Perf)",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "medium"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-08-verification",
      content: "Final verification scripts",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    }
  ]
})
```

### TodoList Update Protocol

**When starting a phase:**
```javascript
// First read current state
todoread()

// Then mark task as in_progress
todowrite({
  todos: [
    // ... existing tasks ...
    {
      id: "orch-02-planning",
      content: "Create planning artifacts",
      status: "in_progress",
      priority: "high"
    },
    // ... other tasks ...
  ]
})
```

**When completing a phase:**
```javascript
// Mark completed and next as in_progress
todowrite({
  todos: [
    {
      id: "orch-02-planning",
      content: "Create planning artifacts",
      status: "completed",
      priority: "high"
    },
    {
      id: "orch-03-tasks",
      content: "Generate task breakdown (/tasks)",
      status: "in_progress",
      priority: "high"
    },
    // ... other tasks ...
  ]
})
```

### STOP Points with TodoList

At each STOP point, update todolist BEFORE asking user:

1. **After Phase 1 (Planning):**
   - Update todolist: Mark Phase 1 tasks as `completed`
   - Mark Phase 2 first task as `in_progress`
   - Ask: "Plan recorded in `docs/`. Proceed to implementation?"

 2. **After Phase 2 (Implementation):**
    - Update todolist: Mark all Phase 2 tasks as `completed`
    - Mark Phase 3 as `in_progress`
    - Ask: "Implementation complete. Run final verification (Phase 3)?"

 3. **After Phase 3 (Verification):**
    - Update todolist: Mark all tasks as `completed`
     - Ask: "All checks passed. Mark the project as complete?"

---

## Question Tool Enforcement (MANDATORY)

The orchestrator MUST use the `question` tool whenever the user needs to choose between 2 or more options.

Examples that MUST use `question`:
- Multiple next steps ("I can do A or B")
- Workflow forks ("Continue / stop / change direction")
- Any preference selection (environment, approach, scope)

NEVER present multiple options as plain text and wait for a free-form reply. Use `question`.

### Standard "Next Steps" Question

Use this template when offering follow-ups:

```javascript
question({
  questions: [{
    header: "Proximos Passos",
    question: "Escolha o proximo passo.",
    options: [
      { label: "Continuar com fixes", description: "Aplicar pequenas correcoes e seguir auditoria" },
      { label: "Gerar relatorio", description: "So consolidar achados e backlog" },
      { label: "Parar aqui", description: "Nao fazer mais mudancas agora" }
    ],
    multiple: false
  }]
})
```

---

## Mode 1: Router Mode (Specialized Workflows)

Use these commands for focused tasks:

| Command | Purpose | Use When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/specify` | **Specification** | Create feature specification. |
| `/clarify` | **Clarification** | Resolve spec ambiguities. |
| `/plan` | **Planning** | Create implementation plan. |
| `/tasks` | **Tasking** | Generate executable tasks. |
| `/analyze` | **Analysis** | Validate spec/plan/tasks. |
| `/checklist` | **Checklist** | Spec/plan readiness checks. |
| `/impl` | **Implementation** | Writing code, fixing bugs, adding features. |
| `/test` | **Testing** | Generating or running tests. |
| `/deploy` | **Deployment** | Deploying to production or staging. |
| `/doc` | **Documentation** | Writing/Updating docs only. |
| `/debug` | **Debugging** | Investigating complex errors. |
| `/ui-ux` | **Design** | Creating design systems or UI components. |
| `/context`| **Analysis** | Generating context packs. |
| `/status` | **Progress** | Viewing active tasks and stats. |
| `/preview` | **Dev Environment** | Managing Docker Compose. |

**Usage:**
```
/specify add user profiles
/clarify
/plan add user profiles
/tasks
/impl from docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/TASKS.md
```

### Mandatory Discovery + Planning + Docs (All Code Work)

- **Before any /impl or code modification:**
  1. Run `/context` (ALWAYS required) to refresh the project map and capture current risks.
  2. Run `/brainstorm` (OPTIONAL, when scope is unclear) to explore options.
  3. Run `/specify …` to create the feature spec in `docs/requirements/<feature>/`.
  4. Run `/clarify` to close critical ambiguities.
  5. Run `/plan …` to create `PLAN.md`, `SPRINT_GOAL.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `RISK_REGISTER.md`. _No coding is allowed until the plan exists and is approved._
  6. Run `/tasks` to generate `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/TASKS.md` with INPUT->OUTPUT->VERIFY criteria.
- **After implementation:** run `/doc …` to record what changed and link it back to the plan. Every code change must have an explicit plan + documentation trail.
- The orchestrator must block execution if discovery or planning has been skipped, and remind contributors to update docs immediately after coding.

**Standard Phase Flow:**
```
Phase 0: /context (MANDATORY) → /brainstorm (optional)
Phase 1: /specify → /clarify (optional)
Phase 2: /plan → STOP for approval
Phase 3: /tasks → STOP for approval
Phase 4: /impl → parallel agents
Phase 5: /test, /checklist scripts → /doc
```

---

## Mode 2: Orchestrator Mode (Complex Missions)

**Trigger:** When the task is complex, requires multiple domains, or doesn't fit a single command.

**Goal:** Coordinate specialized agents (Frontend, Backend, Database, Security) to solve the problem.

### Critical Rules
- **Documentation:** All plans MUST follow Documentation Integrity Protocol
- **Discovery Gate:** Always execute `/context` (MANDATORY) before authoring a new plan. Use `/brainstorm` additionally when scope is unclear.
- **Planning Gate:** `/impl` or specialist agents cannot run until `/specify`, `/clarify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` have produced the required docs.
- **Post-Work Docs:** After implementation, `/doc` must be used to capture outcomes linked to the plan.
- **Minimum 3 Agents:** If you use fewer than 3, you are not orchestrating
- **Standard Phase Execution (aligned with SDD workflow):**
    - **Phase 0: Discovery** - `/context` (MANDATORY), `/brainstorm` (optional)
    - **Phase 1: Specification** - `/specify`, `/clarify`
    - **Phase 2: Planning** - `/plan` → STOP for approval
    - **Phase 3: Task Breakdown** - `/tasks` → STOP for approval
    - **Phase 4: Implementation** - `/impl` with parallel agents
    - **Phase 5: Verification** - Scripts and tests

### Orchestration Protocol

#### Step 1: Analyze & Plan (Phase 1)

1. ** Chain of Thought (MANDATORY):**
    - *Language:* Detect user language from first message and maintain session consistency
    - *Input:* What did the user strictly ask?
    - *Intent:* What is the implicit goal?
    - *Domains:* Which specialists are required?
    - *Reasoning:* Why is this complex enough for orchestration?

2. **Identify Domains:** Security, Backend, Frontend, Database, etc.
3. **Agent:** Use `project-planner` to create docs artifacts in `docs/requirements/` and `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/`
4. **STOP:** Ask the user "Plan recorded in docs. Proceed to implementation?"

#### Step 2: Execute (Phase 2)

After approval, invoke agents in **PARALLEL** groups:

1. **Foundation:** `database-architect`, `security-auditor`
2. **Core:** `backend-specialist`, `frontend-specialist`
3. **Polish:** `test-engineer`, `devops-engineer`

#### Step 3: Verify & Report

1. **Execute Scripts (MANDATORY):**
   - `python .opencode/scripts/checklist.py .`
   - `python .opencode/skills/vulnerability-scanner/scripts/security_scan.py .`
2. **Synthesize:** Create final report summarizing all agent contributions
3. **STOP:** Ask the user "Implementation complete. Run final verification?"

 #### Step 4: Phase 3 - Final Verification

Execute full verification suite:
```bash
python .opencode/scripts/verify_all.py . --url http://localhost:3000
```

Mark Phase 3 complete in plan file only after ALL checks pass.

## Routing Logic

```
User Request
    ↓
Parse Command
    ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ /plan, /impl,   │  → Router Mode
│ /test, /debug   │    (Single command)
└─────────────────┘
    ↓
Complex task?
    ├─ Yes → Orchestrator Mode
    │        (Multi-agent coordination)
    └─ No  → Continue with single agent
```

---

## Example Usage

**Router Mode:**
> "/plan create auth system" → Runs the `/plan` command

**Orchestrator Mode:**
> "/engineer build a secure e-commerce checkout with stripe"
> 1. Detects complexity
> 2. Starts Orchestration Mode
> 3. Plans with `project-planner`
> 4. Executes with `backend-specialist` (API), `frontend-specialist` (UI), `security-auditor` (PCI compliance)

## Semantic Memory Integration (If Enabled)

> **Note:** This section applies only when the semantic memory plugin is installed.
> Check if `.opencode/plugins/semantic-memory/` exists before using memory tools.

### Memory Tools

If semantic memory is enabled, use these tools to optimize context:

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_context` | Before starting complex tasks - retrieves relevant past decisions |
| `memory_save` | After making important decisions - persists knowledge for future sessions |
| `memory_query` | When you need specific past context |
| `memory_stats` | To check memory system health |

### Orchestrator Memory Protocol

1. **Before Planning Phase:**
   ```
   [Use memory_context with task="<mission description>"]
   ```
   Retrieve relevant past decisions before creating new plans.

2. **After Implementation Phase:**
   ```
   [Use memory_save with type="decision" for each major architectural choice]
   ```
   Capture decisions made during the mission.

3. **When Delegating to Sub-Agents:**
   Include relevant memories in the Task prompt:
   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type: "backend-specialist",
     prompt: """
     Implement user authentication API.
     
     Relevant context from project memory:
     - We use JWT tokens (not sessions)
     - PostgreSQL for user storage
     - bcrypt for password hashing
     
     [Full task description...]
     """
   )
   ```

### What to Save

**SAVE with `memory_save`:**
- Architecture decisions (database, framework, patterns)
- Error fixes with root cause analysis
- Design patterns adopted for the project
- Security decisions and rationale
- Configuration choices and why

**DO NOT SAVE:**
- Trivial changes (typo fixes, formatting)
- Temporary workarounds
- Sensitive data (credentials, tokens)

### Memory Check (Optional)

Periodically verify memory health:
```
[Use memory_stats]
```

See `.opencode/rules/SEMANTIC_MEMORY.md` for complete protocol.

---

## Execution Order Priority

| Priority | Phase | Agents | When to Use |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **P0** | Foundation | `database-architect` → `security-auditor` | If project needs DB |
| **P1** | Core | `backend-specialist` | If project has backend |
| **P2** | UI/UX | `frontend-specialist` OR `mobile-developer` | Web OR Mobile (not both!) |
| **P3** | Polish | `test-engineer`, `performance-optimizer`, `seo-specialist` | Based on needs |

---

 ## Phase 3: Final Verification (MANDATORY)

>  **DO NOT mark project complete until ALL scripts pass.**

### Verification Order:

1. **P0: Lint & Type Check**
   ```bash
   npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

2. **P0: Security Scan**
   ```bash
   python .opencode/skills/vulnerability-scanner/scripts/security_scan.py .
   ```

3. **P1: UX Audit**
   ```bash
   python .opencode/skills/frontend-design/scripts/ux_audit.py .
   ```

4. **P3: Lighthouse (requires server)**
   ```bash
   python .opencode/skills/performance-profiling/scripts/lighthouse_audit.py http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **P4: Playwright E2E (requires server)**
   ```bash
   python .opencode/skills/webapp-testing/scripts/playwright_runner.py http://localhost:3000 --screenshot
   ```

### All-in-One Command:
```bash
python .opencode/scripts/verify_all.py . --url http://localhost:3000
```

## Documentation Standards

All planning artifacts MUST be recorded in `docs/` and include:
- **Docs Hub** in `docs/HUB-DOCS.md`
- **Requirements Hub** in `docs/requirements/HUB-REQUIREMENTS.md`
- **Feature Hub** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/HUB-<FEATURE>.md`
- **Problem Statement** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md`
- **User Stories** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/USER_STORIES.md`
- **Acceptance Criteria** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md`
- **Data Contracts** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/DATA_CONTRACTS.md`
- **Risks** in `docs/requirements/<feature>/RISKS.md`
- **Sprint Hub** in `docs/sprint/HUB-SPRINTS.md`
- **Sprint Index** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/HUB-SPRINT-XX.md`
- **Sprint Goal** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/SPRINT_GOAL.md`
- **Backlog** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/BACKLOG.md`
- **Tasks** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/TASKS.md` with INPUT→OUTPUT→VERIFY
- **Risk Register** in `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/RISK_REGISTER.md`

All documentation artifacts must also follow Obsidian linking conventions:
- Use wikilinks for internal references, for example `[[docs/HUB-DOCS.md]]`
- Add `## Related` sections to connect docs
- Keep links stable to support context retrieval and long-term memory
- Use canonical docs filenames from `.opencode/rules/DOCS_FILE_GLOSSARY.md`

---

## STOP Points (MANDATORY)

1. **After Phase 1 (Planning):**
   > "Plan recorded in `docs/`. Proceed to implementation?"

 2. **After Phase 2 (Implementation):**
    > "Implementation complete. Run final verification (Phase 3)?"

 3. **After Phase 3 (Verification):**
    > "All checks passed. Mark the project as complete?"

---

## Notes

- Always read the appropriate agent file before invoking via task tool
- Check agent frontmatter for required skills
- Never skip validation scripts
- Dynamic naming: `{task-slug}.md` based on task keywords
- Location: Project root (NOT docs/ folder)

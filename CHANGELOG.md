# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenKit CLI will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.12] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- CLI top-level command surface simplified to task-oriented commands: `init`, `sync`, `doctor`, `check`, `upgrade`, `uninstall`, and `memory`.
- Agent selection is now explicit via `--agent` for `init`, `sync`, and `doctor` (default `opencode`).
- `openkit init` without `PROJECT_NAME` now initializes in the current directory by default.

### Removed
- Removed legacy top-level provider aliases (`openkit opencode|claude|cursor|gemini|codex|antigravity ...`).
- Removed legacy init selectors (`--ai`, `--claude`, `--codex`, `--cursor`, `--gemini`, `--antigravity`) and `--here`.

### Fixed
- Added `openkit init --overwrite` semantics to explicitly replace existing agent pack files (e.g. `.opencode/**`) with current templates.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- `openkit init` now materializes full agent template packs from `internal/templates/base/**` and injects `MEMORY_KERNEL.md` into agent rules.
- New agent selection flags for initialization: `--claude`, `--codex`, `--cursor`, `--gemini`, `--antigravity` (default remains OpenCode).

### Changed
- OpenKit template documentation root migrated from `docs/` to `openkit-memory/` across internal templates.
- `opencode.json` template policy is now permission-centric (removed boolean `tools` blocks in favor of explicit `permission` mapping).
- Memory Kernel defaults are now sourced from embedded templates (`internal/templates/memory/*.yaml`) instead of hardcoded Rust structs.

### Fixed
- Restored Rust parity by wiring `init/sync` to the real template source-of-truth in `internal/templates/**`.

## [0.5.10] - 2026-02-18

### Changed
- Removed minisign from release/update flow to keep upgrade path checksum-only and operationally simple.

### Fixed
- Simplified release pipeline by removing minisign install/signing steps that introduced extra failure modes.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- Release workflow now supports encrypted minisign keys via optional `MINISIGN_PASSWORD` secret and falls back to `-W` for unencrypted keys.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- Release workflow minisign signing is now non-interactive in CI by using `-W` with unencrypted secret keys.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Release workflow optional checksums signing with `minisign` when `MINISIGN_SECRET_KEY` is configured.

### Changed
- `openkit upgrade` now supports optional signature enforcement for `checksums.txt.minisig` when `OPENKIT_MINISIGN_PUBKEY` is set.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Rust-native `openkit uninstall` command with interactive confirmation, `--yes`, and `--dry-run` modes.
- Checksum parsing coverage for release artifact verification paths.

### Changed
- `openkit upgrade` now performs Rust-native self-update on Linux/macOS with SHA-256 validation from `checksums.txt` and atomic binary replacement with rollback.
- Windows `openkit upgrade` keeps the official PowerShell installer flow.
- CLI/API documentation and Sprint-09 parity matrix updated to reflect completed upgrade/uninstall parity.

### Fixed
- Improved `upgrade --dry-run` output to show selected release asset per platform.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Obsidian-compatible documentation standard with canonical file glossary and link protocol.
- New `docs-migration-specialist` agent to migrate legacy docs to wikilinks, hubs, and canonical filenames.
- New docs templates and hubs for `README`, glossary, migration checklist, requirements index, feature index, sprint index, and analysis.

### Changed
- `/engineer` now detects legacy docs drift and routes to docs migration before planning when needed.
- Commands, prompts, rules, and templates were aligned to Obsidian graph-style documentation and uppercase canonical artifact naming.
- CLI embedded docs scaffolding now creates connected index files and migration artifacts by default.

### Fixed
- Resolved command inconsistencies around ownership and naming of planning/task artifacts (`TASKS.md`, `DATA_CONTRACTS.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `ANALYSIS.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`).

## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- CI: build golangci-lint using the job Go toolchain and address lint findings
- Release: align Go version with `go.mod` to keep GoReleaser builds consistent

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- Hardened security scan gating: skip internal tooling packs and exit non-zero on critical/high findings

### Changed
- Finalized validation for Cursor and Codex targets
- Updated risk register and sprint artifacts

### Documentation
- Synced Sprint 04 backlog

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- Hardened `openkit upgrade --check` to use HEAD requests with GET fallback for better compatibility
- Improved error handling for rate limits (403) and missing artifacts (404)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- Added `openkit upgrade --check` flag to verify updates without installing
- Added `openkit upgrade --dry-run` alias
- Documentation for CLI self-upgrade and uninstall process

### Fixed
- Corrected release asset filenames in README to `openkit_*`

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- Unit tests for self-update artifact filename generation

### Changed
- Refactored upgrade code to centralize artifact filename generation

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- Fixed `openkit upgrade` downloading the correct release artifact name prefix (`openkit_...`) to avoid 404s
- Updated uninstall script to support non-interactive mode for piped execution (`curl ... | bash`) and `-y/--yes`

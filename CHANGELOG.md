and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.5] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- Rust-native `openkit uninstall` command with interactive confirmation, `--yes`, and `--dry-run` modes.
- Checksum parsing coverage for release artifact verification paths.

### Changed
- `openkit upgrade` now performs Rust-native self-update on Linux/macOS with SHA-256 validation from `checksums.txt` and atomic binary replacement with rollback.
- Windows `openkit upgrade` keeps the official PowerShell installer flow.
- CLI/API documentation and Sprint-09 parity matrix updated to reflect completed upgrade/uninstall parity.

### Fixed
- Improved `upgrade --dry-run` output to show selected release asset per platform.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Obsidian-compatible documentation standard with canonical file glossary and link protocol.
- New `docs-migration-specialist` agent to migrate legacy docs to wikilinks, hubs, and canonical filenames.
- New docs templates and hubs for `README`, glossary, migration checklist, requirements index, feature index, sprint index, and analysis.

### Changed
- `/engineer` now detects legacy docs drift and routes to docs migration before planning when needed.
- Commands, prompts, rules, and templates were aligned to Obsidian graph-style documentation and uppercase canonical artifact naming.
- CLI embedded docs scaffolding now creates connected index files and migration artifacts by default.

### Fixed
- Resolved command inconsistencies around ownership and naming of planning/task artifacts (`TASKS.md`, `DATA_CONTRACTS.md`, `TECH_STACK.md`, `ANALYSIS.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`).

## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- CI: build golangci-lint using the job Go toolchain and address lint findings
- Release: align Go version with `go.mod` to keep GoReleaser builds consistent

- Updated risk register and sprint artifacts

### Documentation
- Synced Sprint 04 backlog

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

### Changed
- Refactored upgrade code to centralize artifact filename generation

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
